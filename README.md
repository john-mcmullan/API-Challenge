In review the locations that meet our requirements are mostly north of the equator with only 4 in the southern hemisphere. However, 
some of the variables are too hard to predict with much accuracy. Specifically cloudiness and wind speed are to hard to predict. If 
these are crucial to your vacation experience we will need to look into other methods to predict your perfect location.
